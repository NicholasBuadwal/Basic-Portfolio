While most people my age were learning how to walk on their own two feet, I was surfing the web, playing
 halo on my dad's pc and learning how to utilize computers to my benefit. From the time 
 I can remember I was always fascinated with technology and how much it's evolutionized through the ages.
 When my parents would tell me about the bulky cellphones that could barely fit in a pocket, and the 
 desktops that were basically immobile because of their anchor-like weight it would blow my mind.
 I've always known that I want to work with computers as I grew up and when i got the call from the UofT coding bootcamp I 
 jumped at the chance to begin my career as a web developer!
